## Data flow

`useGrocerySync` owns `items` and is the *only* thing allowed to call
`setItems` — every mutation goes through its `updateItems(updater)`,
which both applies the update and schedules a debounced S3 save.
`GroceryList.tsx` and `useItemForm.ts` only ever call `updateItems`,
never a raw setter.

```
useGrocerySync ──items, updateItems──▶ GroceryList.tsx ──▶ GroceryListItem.tsx (rows)
                                              │
                                              └──▶ useItemForm (uses updateItems too)
```

## Pending/acquired boundary ("In Cart" section)

Only rendered when `doShowAll` is on and there's at least one acquired
item. Lives inline in `GroceryList.tsx` (not split into its own
component file — it's one row of JSX plus a handler, and splitting it
out would just add an indirection layer for no real reuse benefit).

- `SectionLabelRow` (in `styles/itemList.ts`) is the flex row holding
  the "In Cart" label and the Clear button side by side.
- **Clear Acquired** deletes via `updateItems`, going through the same
  debounced S3 save as every other mutation — no special-casing.
- It only deletes what's **currently visible** under the active store
  filter (i.e. `acquired`, the already-filtered array), not every
  acquired item in the underlying `items` list. If "Costco" is
  selected, clearing only removes acquired Costco items.
- **Confirm pattern**: first tap arms the button (`clearArmed = true`,
  button turns red, label flips to "Tap again"); second tap actually
  deletes. `clearArmed` resets on blur, on changing the store filter,
  and on toggling "Show All" off — so an armed confirm never silently
  carries over to a different set of items than the one the user was
  looking at when they armed it.
- This inline-arm/confirm approach (vs. a modal or `window.confirm`)
  is the established pattern for destructive actions in this app —
  reuse it if another one gets added later.

## Notes field

Optional free-text per item (brand, size, substitutions, etc.).

- Stored as `notes?: string` on `GroceryItem` (in `s3Storage.ts`) — the `?`
  makes it backward-compatible; items saved before this field existed simply
  have no `notes` key and are treated as `''` throughout the UI.
- `ItemData` in `GroceryList.types.ts` mirrors it as `notes?: string`.
- `EMPTY_FORM` in `useItemForm.ts` initialises it to `''`; `handleEdit`
  maps `item.notes ?? ''`; `handleSubmit` persists it on both add and edit.
- The form renders a `FieldTextarea` (in `styles/sheet.ts`) as the last
  field, full-width, below the store chips.
- **In the list row**: when `item.notes` is non-empty a circle-ⓘ
  (`InfoIcon` in `styles/itemList.ts`) appears immediately to the right
  of the item name inside `ItemBody`. Tapping it opens a read-only notes
  modal (not the edit sheet). The note text is never shown inline in the row.
- **Notes modal**: `notesItem` state in `GroceryList.tsx` holds the item
  being viewed, or `null` when closed. The modal lives in `styles/modal.ts`
  (`ModalOverlay`, `ModalCard`, `ModalItemName`, `ModalNoteText`,
  `ModalDismissBtn`). Tapping the overlay or the "Done" button closes it.
  `ModalCard` stops propagation so clicks on the card don't bubble to the
  overlay dismiss handler.
- To edit a note, use swipe-left on the row as normal — the modal is
  intentionally read-only.

## Item name autocomplete & history

When adding or editing an item, the name field shows a dropdown of previously
used item names. Selecting a suggestion populates store, department, quantity,
and notes from the last time an item with that name was saved. Acquired status
is always reset to false (not stored in history).

### Storage

History is stored at `grocery-lists/history.json` in the same S3 bucket as
the list. The document is a flat JSON object mapping a **lowercased item name**
to a `HistoryEntry`:

```jsonc
{
  "whole milk":  { "store": ["Aldi"], "department": "Dairy", "quantity": "1", "notes": "" },
  "eggs":        { "store": ["Trader Joe's"], "department": "Dairy", "quantity": "2", "notes": "large" }
}
```

History saves are best-effort (no ETag locking). A last-write-wins race between
two concurrent users is harmless — both writes are valid history entries.

### Session caching

History is fetched once per browser session (module-level cache in
`useItemForm.ts`) and updated optimistically on every submit, so the dropdown
reflects a new item name immediately without waiting for the S3 round-trip.

### Dropdown behaviour

- Opens on focus of the item name field (showing all history) and filters
  as the user types (prefix matches appear first, then substring matches).
- On mobile the dropdown is `position: fixed`, with coordinates derived from
  the input's `getBoundingClientRect()` — this escapes the Sheet's
  `overflow-y: auto` clipping. Coordinates are re-measured on viewport resize
  (virtual keyboard appear/disappear) and scroll.
- Keyboard: arrow keys move the active suggestion, Enter selects, Escape/Tab
  closes without selecting.
- On mobile, `onPointerDown` with `preventDefault()` is used instead of
  `onClick` to prevent the input from blurring before the selection registers.
